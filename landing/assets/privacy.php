    <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
    <p>We do not actually collect any information from our users other than the standard information that our website statistics automatically gathers. The following is just a standard Privacy Policy agreement. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>

    <h3>II. Information about website visits</h3>
    <p>We may collect information about your computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability, and for marketing purposes.<br />Many web surfers are concerned about their privacy and the use of 'cookies' on the Internet. Cookies are small files that can be used to store information you have already provided. Cookies cannot be used to "steal" information about you or your computer system. This website uses cookies to remember your preferences. For example, the website may remember which page you view, in order to make your next visit more convenient (by displaying information more relevant to that store location). Nevertheless, if you don't like having any cookies at all they can be disabled in your web browser's Internet Options. This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>

To the extent that we are required to do so by law;<br />2. In connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;<br />3. In order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk);<br />4.
